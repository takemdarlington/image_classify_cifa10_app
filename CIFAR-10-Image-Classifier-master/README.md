# CIFAR-10-Image-Classifier

This is my second project in my Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation (Udacity). Using the template that Udacity provided, I added the necessary code to build a convolutional neural network, with TensorFlow, to predict images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The easiest way to view my code is to look at the .ipynb file.

helper.py contains helper functions that were provided by Udacity.

problem_unittests.py contains tests to ensure that I am correctly building my CNN as I progress through the project; provided by Udacity.

The data is from the University of Toronto (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). If you choose to play with this code, you will be able to download the data using the code at the start of the project.
